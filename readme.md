# Contactless Temperature Measurement with ATMega328p

THIS IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE - I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL

#### Proof of Concept on STM32F401RE: https://github.com/nt-com/CTmeasure

### Detailed documentation: See /doc/doc.pdf

### Usage:

go to /src/ folder
compile with make
do sudo ./flash_script 
when it asks you what to flash type app and press enter
the software should be running on the microcontroller now
go to src and start either plot_serial.py or read_serial.py (probably need to do this as root)
